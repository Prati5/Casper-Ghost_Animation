# Casper-Ghost_Animation
OpenGL project to show the animation and the use of mouse click events.

In this project we have used a openGL library functions to draw the body of the casper ghost. We have added the music file to give sound effect.
I have used a linux system , So used fork function to avoid the synchrounous events(synchronous events;music won't allow the animation to run unless it is completed).
Windows user can use "playsound" function for the same.
When you run the program:
* Static Casper Ghost will appear.
* When you click the right button of the mouse, background color will change from blue color to red color.
* When you click the left button,casper movement will be shown.
* When you click the middle button of the mouse, it will exit.
